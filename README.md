## General info

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by _Francesco Cirillo_ in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a _pomodoro_, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) and [iterative and incremental development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) used in software design, the method has been adopted in [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) contexts.
